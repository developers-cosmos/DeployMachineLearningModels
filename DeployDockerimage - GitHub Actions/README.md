<i>What if I told you “You can automate the process of building, testing, delivering, or deploying your Machine Learning models into production”?</i><br><br>
The world’s most popular hosted repository service, GitHub is providing an integrated way to design and develop our workflows by automating the tasks through GitHub Actions. With Actions, the events that take place in our GitHub repository like pushes, pull requests, releases, etc. are used as triggers to kick-off the workflows.<br><br>
